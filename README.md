# Spot Version 3


**Spot Version 3** is a redesigned prototype of a student coursework management platform, created to improve usability, clarity, and overall student experience compared to the existing system.

The project focuses on clearer deadline tracking, better grade visibility, and more structured presentation of academic information, while exploring how thoughtful design and modern web technologies can improve everyday student workflows.

## 🎯 Project Context

Universities rely heavily on digital platforms to manage coursework, deadlines, and feedback. However, existing systems often suffer from poor usability, unclear data presentation, and inefficient interaction flows.

**Spot Version 3** was developed as a student-led initiative to rethink this experience from the ground up, addressing real pain points encountered by students during their studies.

The project was recognised among the strongest submissions in the cohort and awarded  
**“Most Carefully Routed Application”**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**  
- **Modern Web Technologies** (component-based frontend architecture)
- **UI/UX Design & Prototyping**
- **Design Scaffolding:** Lovable (initial structure)

---

## 🧩 Implementation Details

- The initial interface structure and layout were generated using **Lovable** as a design and scaffolding tool.
- The resulting codebase was **manually reviewed, modified, and extended**:
  - TypeScript logic was adapted and refined
  - Component structure and formatting were customised
  - UI behaviour and data presentation were adjusted to match project requirements
- Design decisions were guided by usability principles, clarity of information, and real student use cases.

This approach allowed rapid prototyping while retaining **full control over the final implementation**.

## ✨ Key Features

- Clear overview of modules and associated coursework
- Structured deadline timelines and weighting visibility
- Improved layout hierarchy for grades and feedback
- Student-focused navigation and interaction flow
- Emphasis on readability and data clarity

---

## 👥 Team & Collaboration

This project was developed collaboratively as part of a university coursework initiative, with a strong emphasis on:
- team communication
- iterative design
- feedback-driven improvements
